Data instructions

Place the required CSV files in the `Dataset/` folder:
- `Dataset/application_data.csv`
- `Dataset/previous_application.csv`

If you don't have the files locally, download them from the original source and put them in the `Dataset/` folder before running the notebook. Optionally, add a `scripts/download_data.ps1` or `scripts/download_data.sh` to automate downloads.
